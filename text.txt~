Thompson said a search warrant was executed at Schreiber's home, where investigators reported finding evidence linked to the arson, as well as anti-Islamic social media posts.

A Facebook page apparently belonging to the suspect, established under his name with photos resembling his booking photo, include a message posted on July 12 that said "ALL ISLAM IS RADICAL, and should be considered TERRORIST AND CRIMANALS" written in capital letters with several mispellings.

Wilfredo Amr Ruiz, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations Florida (CAIR-Florida), responded to social media posts by Schreiber claiming to be a Jew who was "fighting back".

"He obviously doesn't know about the efforts our community is engaged in with our cousins, the Jews, not only in Florida but throughout the nation," Ruiz said.
